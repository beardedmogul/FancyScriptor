# Scriptor
A PowerShell script organization / execution tool

SCRIPTOR allows you to organize your PowerShell scrips into a Windows folder structure with folders becoming sub-menus and the scripts in those folders becoming menu items.

SCRIPTOR also allows you to pass parameters to your scripts, such as credentials stored in Windows Credential Manager.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get started, download the source files and organize your scripts under the '\scripts\' directory.


Modules can be placed in the '\scripts\#modules\' folder.  Modules allow you to import common functionality into several scripts rather than putting the same functions in each scripts.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SCRIPTOR must be run from the Desktop PowerShell version as Administrator.
